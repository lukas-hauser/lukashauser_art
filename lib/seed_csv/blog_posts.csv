Upcycled Marshall Speaker Cabinet,upcycled-marshall-speaker-cabinet,upcycling,28/09/2018,"<h4>No well-functioning Marshall was harmed</h4>

<p>When I got a hold of an old non-working Marshall guitar speaker cabinet, I decided to breathe new life into it. Serious gigging history has also taken its toll. The vinyl cover was completely stripped off and the previous owner made a few modifications to the cab, leaving it with multiple holes in the wood. The cab didn’t work anymore and 3 of the 4 Celestion speakers were in a very bad condition.  Therefore,  I decided to repurpose it rather than trying to repair it.  I upcycled this Marshall speaker cabinet into a liquor cabinet to store and showcase my whiskey collection.
Please note that I’m neither a guitar amplifier specialist, nor have I knowledge about cabinetry or woodworking. I’m an upcycle enthusiast and applied DIY tips and inputs from friends, family, as well as online research and videos. Any comments and suggestions are appreciated. What would you do differently?
I hope you enjoy this post about the upcycled Marshall speaker cabinet. Don’t forget to comment below and share! Sign up to my newsletter and follow me on instagram to find out about future projects.</p>

<h4>Disassemble the Cabinet</h4>

<p>Before I started upcycling this cabinet, I removed the backplate, loudspeaker frame, the handles and casters. I used a flat screwdriver to remove the plastic corners that were attached with rivets. In the first picture, you can see that the previous owner painted the whole cabinet white. Hence, I had to remove the white paint from the plastic corners with solvents.</p>

<h4>Remove Tolex Glue Residue</h4>

<p>If you’re lucky enough, you find a cabinet in a nice condition. Unfortunately, the Tolex of my cabinet was already stripped off, leaving a thick layer of glue residue on the the outside of the wood. This residue was still soft and gunky and hence, I started scraping it off using a palette knife that I found in my oil painting accessories. However, there are definitely better tools for that purpose. Later on, I also got a poster stripping knife that made my life a bit easier. I used a flat screwdriver to access small corners. A chisel would probably have been easier to work with. However, I’ve tried to use the tools available as much as possible.
Because this process was very painstaking, I tried to figure out if there were better ways to get rid off the glue. Depending on how hard the remnants are, they could also be sanded down and if there’s only a thin layer of glue left, solvents could be used. Because I was I was working on this project in our living room, I preferred to do as little sanding as possible. Apparently, some glues contain toxins, so you might want to protect yourself with a breathing mask.</p>

<h4>Fill Holes in the Wood</h4>
<p>I used wood filler to even out all the unnecessary drilling holes and the caster cup holes on the top. Because the cabinet will be used as a piece of furniture, I didn’t see any need in the use of handles anymore. Instead, I glued in pieces of wood and used wood filler in the remaining gaps. Apply the filler in layers and let it dry. Not having handles also made it easier to cover the cabinet in vinyl. If the Tolex on your cabinet is still fine or if you don’t intend to add Tolex, I would suggest to keep the handles. I sold the handles of this cab on ebay.</p>

<h4>Re-Tolex the Cabinet</h4>
<p>The next step, which I found the most painful and time-intense, was glueing the vinyl on. If the cabinet I used was built in a nice solid wood instead of MDF, I would have painted it in a nice black satin (see-through) finish rather than covering it with vinyl. Anyway, I won’t go into detail on how to apply Tolex to the cabinet as there are various ways and great tutorials already out there. Two 90 cm increments of 136cm wide Tolex were sufficient to cover the cabinet using a 4-seams approach. There were even left overs to cover a shelf and inside bottom of the cabinet.
Wrapping it around corners was the biggest challenge. I initially thought the cabinet would look nicer without the plastic corners. However, I ended up adding them in the end to cover up little mistakes. Because I worked on this DIY project at home, I looked for a non-toxic glue and went for a water-based Tolex glue. Make sure to apply it to both the Tolex and the wood and wait until it’s tacky. Patience is key here.</p>

<h4>Paint</h4>
<p>I used furniture paint for the inside of the cabinet and the the door. There’s various types of paints with various finishes. If the wood looks nice, I would go for a satin/see-through finish to show the texture of the wood. On MDF, I preferred opaque gloss paint.</p>

<h4>Shelf</h4>
<p>I used a 635x280mm and 18mm thick plywood sheet as a shelf and added scrap wood as shelf supports. I added the spare tolex to the shelf and the bottom inside of the cabinet.</p>

<h4>Door</h4>
<p>When measuring  the door size, account enough room for the piping. I used plywood as I thought it might be easer to drill the hinge holes etc. In hindsight, MDF might have been a better option. Also, after I added the grill cloth and the piping, the measurement turned out a bit tight.
I drilled the holes to attach the Marshall logo and for the hinges. Afterwards, I painted the door black and used a staple gun to attach the grill cloth and piping. For a future project, I would look for different materials. While the grill cloth and piping work well on actual speaker cabinets, they aren’t great when fitting on a liquor cabinet door. What would you suggest to use?</p>

<h4>Hinges</h4>
<p>When it comes to hinges, they have to be inset hinges, because the door will be within a frame. A thick door inset hinge might be an even better choice. Because I wanted to avoid installing a door knob or handle, I used a push to open mechanism. I added pieces of wood level the surface with the frame, so I could attach the hinges.</p>

<h4>Light</h4>
<p>I wanted to install a light that automatically goes on when opening the cabinet. Because I never want to change any batteries, I opted for a USB-chargeable LED light. It is mounted with a magnet strip and can easily be removed to charge.</p>

<h4>Other Takeaways: Screwing in MDF</h4>
<p>From what I’ve learnt online, MDF has the tendency to split when screwing into it. Hence, I always went for a pilot hole before adding the screw. I used multi-purpose screws which were designed for various materials, including MDF.</p>

Exhibition with a Twist,exhibition-with-a-twist,art,2019-05-13,"<p> I would like to thank everyone who visited us in the gallery last week. I am still overwhelmed by how many people joined us for the Vernissage on Friday. It was an honour to showcase my art to such a great crowd and I loved explaining and discussing my pieces. Next to that, I enjoyed catching up with old friends, meeting new awesome people and having interesting conversations. I hope that everyone had as much fun as I had!</p>

<p>For me, the awesomeness of these few days didn’t end there. As most of you might already know, I also got engaged. I secretly painted a very special piece in our living room whenever my girlfriend (now fiancé) wasn’t home. I unveiled it to her and popped the question one day before the Vernissage. I wouldn’t exaggerate if I called the last few days the best days of my life.</p>

<p>However, don’t worry if you weren’t able to attend. I am sure that we will organise more events in the future. I hope to see you at upcoming events and send you big thanks for following and supporting me and my art & photography endeavours. Please sign up to my newsletter and follow me on instagram to stay updated.</p>

Exhibition - Gilded Cage: An Escape Journey on Canvas,exhibition-gilded-cage,art,2019-03-28,"<p>Lukas Hauser is excited to present his first art exhibition. In a series of paintings, he attempts to reconstruct the feeling of being trapped in a monotonous routine. Although his paintings consist of mixed styles and subjects, including portraits, figurative and abstract pieces, they reflect his deepest thoughts and feelings on the escape journey.</p>

<p>After a first figurative piece named “Only from the inside, a hamster wheel looks like a career ladder”, he created twisted interpretations of well-known works of art to learn from the Greats and to develop his own style; Van Gogh’s sunflower vase explodes and Trump stares down from a contemporary version of Holbein’s Henry VIII. Fascinated by old masters, Hauser pursued portraiture, an art genre that he finds particularly challenging, but also rewarding when a piece turns out well.</p>

<p>As the artist’s practice evolves, a style has become apparent. Deep, mysterious blacks are in strong contrast with light tones and bright colours. Next to his realistic work, he created abstract and experimental pieces. Although Hauser’s paintings consist of mixed styles and subjects, they reflect his deepest thoughts and feelings on the escape journey. He hopes to evoke similar reactions in the viewer.</p>

<p>Lukas Hauser was born in Switzerland and enthusiastically filled sketchbooks in his childhood until starting a finance career at 16. Apart from rare visits to his father’s art studio, he abandoned brush and canvas for more than a decade. He revived his creativity after moving to London where he became interested in street photography as a result of the vibrant and ever-changing backdrop of London and its inhabitants. Another four years later, he came across brush set, tiny paint tubes and small canvases in a Pound store, which inspired him to re-acquaint himself with his artistic nature. When the first piece was finished, his love of painting was reborn. Next to self-study, he attended two painting classes and practiced in residence.</p>

<p>Hauser is particularly excited to reveal a previously unpublished piece at the private view. Alongside his paintings, the artist will showcase a selection of photographs relevant to the theme. In addition to his own photographs, he is pleased to include contributions from his good friend Conrad Ho, who takes mundane everyday items or scenes and reinterprets them with technology, using different modern photographic techniques to create a new image.</p>",https://i1.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Escaping-the-Gilded-Cage-e1549753597357.jpg https://i2.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Eventbrite-Picture.jpg?ssl=1 https://i2.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gilded-Cage-Flyer.jpg?ssl=1 https://i0.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gilded-Cage-Flyer-Back-e1553792005952.jpg?ssl=1 https://i2.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hamster-Wheel-Painting-scaled.jpg

"My First Ever Street Photography Book
",first-street photography-book,photography,2017-06-23,"<p>Aloha!</p>

<p>I’m excited to announce that I’ve completed the book on the street photography series “Honeymoon Factory Waikiki”. This is not only my first ever street photography book, but was also my first time ever shooting a theme-based series with a project in mind.</p>

<p>This book looks at the factory-like honeymoon tourism in Honolulu’s beachfront neighbourhood. Waikiki is a popular place for lovebirds wearing matching clothing as well as for couples in wedding dresses who run around in tuxedos to do their pre wedding photo shoot.</p>

<p>You can order the book <a href=""http://www.blurb.co.uk/b/8015078-honeymoon-factory-waikiki"">here</a>. There is a preview function that allows you to flick through a couple of pages for a first impression. I’m happy to hear your comments.</p>

Paper Cups and our Throw-Away Society,paper-cups-throwaway-society,art,2016-11-21,"<h4>Pollution Everywhere</h4>

<p>Surfing is one of my passion. I love the stoke that I get from riding waves and find it amazing how I can connect with nature. It allows me to switch off from the everyday hustle and bustle while my mind is focused only on surfing. I am one with the beautiful nature that surrounds me.</p>

<p>Too often though, that serene environment is disturbed by trash. There’s bottles and all other kinds of plastics on the beaches and floating in the ocean. I find it disgusting how humans pollute their surroundings. It leaves the impression that we don’t care about the harm we cause to our environment and the wild animals that often can’t distinguish between food and plastic. We buy stuff, use it and throw it away out of convenience. Plastic bottles, take-away trays, plastic cutlery to name just a few. Even though some of that is recyclable, there is still way too much rubbish ending up at places where it should not.</p>

<h4>Paper Cups are NON-recyclable</h4>

<p>A paper cup is the perfect symbol of our throw-away society. Its life span is super-short. We buy our coffee in a paper cup with a plastic lid on top. It only takes us around 10 minutes until we drink the last sip and dispose of the rubbish. You might now argue: “Dude, the cup is made of paper, so it’s recyclable!” Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Inside the cup, there’s a layer of polyethylene to seal it. This layer cannot be separated from the card at a standard recycling mill. Therefore, tons of paper cups end up in landfills. <a href=""https://www.rivercottage.net/news/wake-up-and-smell-the-waste"">In the UK it is 2.5 billion cups a year</a>. We are creating a waste mountain.</p>

<p>How can this be stopped? Potentially such issues require a regulatory change or an incentive like an additional tax. A recent example was a huge success: <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36917174"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Plastic bag use plummets since a 5p charge has been introduced in the UK</a>. Introducing such an incentive is not in my power and coffee companies don’t show any interest to take responsibility. Hence, I ask myself what I can do to improve the situation. I believe that trying to stop using paper cups myself is not a bad start. I prefer enjoying the coffee in the cafe rather than on the go anyway. During a quick coffee break I can read the news, meet someone or catch up on social media. And the coffee tastes better in a ‘real’ cup. However, many people need to join in to actually make an impact. Therefore, I decided to create art that hopefully looks beautiful and at the same time should raise awareness.</p>

<h4>About My Artwork</h4>

<p>After I neglected one of my passions  for way too long, I’m glad that I’ve finally rediscovered it – my passion for drawing and painting. Since I’ve started my first day job 15 years ago, I’ve hardly dedicated any time to my artistic side. To revive this part of me and to find my own style, I’m currently experimenting with photography, pencil drawing, oil painting and digital art. “Paper Cups and our Throw-Away Society” is one of my first digital creations.</p>

<p>I found the inspiration for my image in pop art. Already Andy Warhol was fascinated by ideas of abundance and the rise in consumer culture and mass production. With consumerism, our throw-away society was born. This is why I found Warhol’s works a great basis for my own project. I used the colours of his painting “Marilyn Diptych 1962”. You might have expected one Warhol’s consumerism works, but I wanted to give paper cups a human touch. When I read the caption of Warhol’s “Marilyn Diptych”, I can draw some parallels to paper cups:
“By repeating the image, he evokes her ubiquitous presence in the media.” – Paper cups are widely used at the moment. You see them everywhere. When you ask for a cappuccino at your favourite coffee place, they intuitively serve it in a paper cup.</p>

<p>“The contrast of vivid colour with black and white, and the effect of fading in the right panel are suggestive of the star’s mortality.” – I hope that people will realise what enormous waste mountains we produce and I wish that paper cups will eventually die out.</p>

<p>What is your view? What should everybody do to reduce our waste? Can you think of a solution? I’m also happy to hear your comments on my artwork. I’m planning to create more pieces with the same theme.</p>",https://i2.wp.com/lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Paper-Coffee-Cups-1.jpg https://lukashauser.art/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pig-Street-Art.jpg
